Elite Dangerous Screenshot text overlay

This script converts bmp screensots from Elite Dangerous to jpg file and ads overlay with name of Sytem, Body, Longitude, Latitude, Heading and Time when and where Screenshot is taken. All data is stored in journal file and script parses journal files and adds data to images. Sub folder Converted is created in same folder where screenshots are usualy taken and all newly created images are saved there while original images are preserved. 

Take a note that you will need to download and save in script folder Roboto-Bold.ttf font (or any other ttf font and change it in script).
